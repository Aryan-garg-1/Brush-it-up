## Now lets talk something about this project

- First, its just the starting of my learning journey in this particular machine learning integration.

- So this project is basically to predict the way of brushing, if the person is brushing the teeth correctly.
 The idea was to let the kids to brush their teeth correctly so that it will help in the long run.

- I and my team preciously worked on project like this where we had the kids to brush their teeh in an interactive way by letting them see themselves in the camera and let the germs go where we tried to put this machine learning model. You can find the project [here](https://github.com/Aryan-garg-1/ToothAid).
